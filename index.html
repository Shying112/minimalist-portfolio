            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Research focus on DNA storage and molecular diagnostics</p>
            <p>To further enhance early cancer detection technology, we have focused on the detection of low-frequency gene variations and successfully developed a technology called Blocker Displacement Amplification (BDA). </p>
            <p>This technology significantly improves detection sensitivity, reduces testing time, and significantly lowers testing costs. In areas such as tumor companion diagnostics, postoperative monitoring, early screening, and diagnosis, mBDA technology is expected to facilitate more hospitals and laboratories in conducting accurate, rapid, and cost-effective testing in a decentralized manner. This is anticipated to encourage more cancer patients to undergo genetic testing, leading to more personalized and targeted treatments.</p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>I graduated with a bachelor's degree from East China University of Science and Technology.</p>
            <p>Ph.D. candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University</p>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>Proficient in various experimental skills, including PCR, qPCR, gel electrophoresis, and sequencing library preparation.</p>
            <p>Hobbies include traditional Chinese painting and public speaking.</p>
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Outstanding graduate </p>
            <p>Recipient of Shanghai Municipal Scholarship</p>
