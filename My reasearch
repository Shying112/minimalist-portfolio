Our country, with its vast population, is also a nation with a high incidence of cancer. However, many cancers often show no obvious symptoms in the early stages, making timely detection quite challenging. In contrast to invasive tissue biopsy techniques, non-invasive molecular diagnostic technologies can detect gene mutations, allowing for the early detection of cancer before symptoms manifest. It is well known that the survival rates of patients with most cancers significantly increase if the disease is detected and treated early. However, current molecular diagnostic cancer detection technologies face two primary challenges: insufficient sensitivity, making early detection of the majority of cancers difficult, and high costs, hindering the implementation of widespread policies for early cancer screening.
